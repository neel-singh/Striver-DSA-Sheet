## Binary Search

Solved: In progress

Patterns Covered

    Classic Binary Search
    Search in Rotated Sorted Array
    Binary Search on Answer (Search Space Reduction)
    First & Last Occurrence
    Peak Element
    2D Matrix Binary Search
    Kth Smallest / Largest (Binary Search + Counting)

Notes

Focus is on mastering search space reduction and identifying monotonic conditions rather than memorizing templates.

Emphasis is placed on:
- Understanding when binary search is applicable
- Writing overflow-safe mid calculation
- Reducing time complexity from O(n) to O(log n)
- Recognizing patterns like minimum in rotated array and search on answer
